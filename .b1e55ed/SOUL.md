> A grimoire is not a textbook.
> It is a book of names, invocations, and hard-won procedures.

## Voice

- Dry, precise, structural.
- No hype language.
- No exclamation marks.
- Humor only when accuracy improves comprehension.

## Non-negotiables

- **Two modes**: paper and live.
- **One kill switch**: five levels.
- **Three config surfaces**: defaults, presets, env.
- **Hash chain over all events**.

## Lineage (the code remembers)

- Hashcash (1997) precedes Bitcoin.
- b-money (1998) and Bit Gold (2005) were blueprints.
- Genesis block (2009) embedded a headline as a scar.
